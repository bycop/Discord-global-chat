```javascript
{
// Your prefix to start the hourly reminder and for others to use the help command
var prefix = "c!";
// ID to delete other users messages and use blacklist command
const ownerID = "215534700284870658"
// name of the channel to chat in and check for
const globalchat = "community-chat"
// name of the log channel
